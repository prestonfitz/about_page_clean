# about_page
This is my IS201 final project, very much experimental as I work on increasingly complex web dev.

I recently updated it to use the Python-Django web framework. It is a little bit messy because of it. I would love to set up something like inheritance, however that would be a lot more work than it is worth. 

I suppose you can create a fork and steal code that you want. I don't know why you would want it. Just use Boostrap instead
